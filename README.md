# cryptocurrency-data-pipeline
Please read the documentation for this project.
Firstly, the dependency files Pipfile and Pipfile.lock are included to help you set up the required environment. 

Additionally, I have provided sample output files to demonstrate the results produced by each step of the pipeline. I have also prepared detailed documentation that outlines the purpose and functionality of each step in the pipeline. I have included a flow chart that visually represents the pipelineâ€™s workflow.
